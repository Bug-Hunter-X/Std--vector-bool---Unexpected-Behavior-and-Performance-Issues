std::vector<bool> is a specialized container in C++ that is often cited as a source of unexpected behavior. While seemingly simple, it deviates from the typical std::vector implementation, leading to potential performance issues and surprising results.  Unlike other std::vector types, it does not store booleans as individual bits. Instead, it employs a bitset-like implementation which involves packing multiple booleans within a single machine word. 

This can have consequences:

* **Performance:** Operations on std::vector<bool> may be slower than expected, particularly for accessing individual elements or performing iterative operations. The bit manipulation and potential cache misses can outweigh the space savings.
* **Memory Management:** While it is space-efficient, the non-standard memory management can make it less interoperable with other code or libraries.
* **Iterators:** Iterators for std::vector<bool> don't behave exactly like iterators for other vectors. They don't dereference to the boolean values directly, instead they act like pointers to bit-positions.

Example:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::vector<bool> boolVec(10);
  boolVec[0] = true;
  std::cout << boolVec[0] << std::endl; //Output might be unexpectedly slow

  return 0;
}
```
